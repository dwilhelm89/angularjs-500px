angularjs-500px
===============

A little 500px popular feed viewer using AngularJS.

This small AngularJS app simply loads up 'popular' feed from 500px and displays

Demo
====

The working application can be seen live [here](http://experiments.warpdesign.fr/angularjs-500px)

Why ?
=====

This small application was developped to getting familiar with AngularJS and these wonderful new developement tools:

* Bower
* Grunt
* Yeoman
* Npm

This is a direct rewrite of an old application I wrote using jQuery and CSS3 a few years back: [CSS 3 experiments](experiments.warpdesign.fr/500photos/)

How to install ?
================

Type `npm install` in a shell and `grunt server` to run the app in development mode and wait for modifications or `grunt build` to build the application.
